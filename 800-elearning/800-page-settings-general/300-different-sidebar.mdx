With the eLearning Theme, you can show different sidebars on a specific page. Just go through the following steps.

- From your **WordPress Dashboard**, go to the **Pages > All Pages** section.

- Choose the required **Page** that you want to customize.

- At the bottom of the page, check for the **Page Settings** option.

- Under the Page Settings option, go to the **General** option.

- Under the **Sidebar option**, use the dropdown list to choose which sidebar content to show.
  
  Available lists are

  - **Default**

  - **Sidebar Right**

  - **Sidebar Left**

  - **Footer One**

  - **Footer Two**
  
  - **Footer three**

  - **Footer four**

> Note: If you have chosen the Left Sidebar in the Layout option and you choose the Right Sidebar in the Sidebar option, then the content of the Right Sidebar will be shown in the Left Sidebar.
