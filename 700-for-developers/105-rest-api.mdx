Masteriyo LMS integrates with the WordPress REST API, allowing external applications to securely interact with your LMS data (courses, users, content) using standard HTTP requests and JSON.

**Prerequisites**

✓ **Masteriyo LMS v1.15.1** or higher (Free version)  
✓ **Masteriyo LMS Pro v2.0** or higher (For premium features)  
✓ **HTTPS connection** (can also be accessed over HTTP, but HTTPS is recommended for security)  

## Key Capabilities
Masteriyo REST API lets your application talk to your LMS system just like a messenger. You can:

- **Read Data**: Fetch course, user progress, categories, or other.  
- **Write Data**: Create or update courses, lessons, or user profiles.  
- **Delete Data**: Remove outdated content programmatically.  
- **Automate Workflows**: Sync data with CRMs, mobile apps, or other tools.  

## Setting Up API Access in Masteriyo LMS?

To set up your course API access in Masteriyo LMS, follow the steps below:

###Generate API Keys

**Step 1:** From your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **Masteriyo >** **Tools > REST API**.

**Step 2:** Click the **ADD New** button, and configure detaisl:

**User:** Choose a user who will own this connection. This can be anyone who has joined or created a course.

**Permissions:** Choose the appropriate access level:

**Read:** Allows viewing data

**Write:** Enables data creation and modification

**Read/Write:** Provides full access to view and modify data

**Description:** Add a meaningful description to identify this API key’s purpose so that it becomes easy to understand later when you have multiple API keys.

**Step 3:** Click on **Generate** and you’ll see a table containing:

An API Key (Username for authentication)

A Secret Key (Password)

Keep these safe as they are your access passes to the API.

**Step 4:** Manage API Keys

You can edit or delete the user from Action tab. Simply click on **⋮**  Actions menu  and perform the required action.

If you’re editing, don’t forget to **Update** after you are satisfied with the changes.

## Making API Requests

### API Response Format

**JSON**: All responses return JSON data.

**Dates**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (e.g., 2025-01-21 14:30:00).

**Prices**: Strings with 2 decimal places (e.g., "price": "50.00").

### Authentication

To make API calls, you’ll need to set up **Basic Authentication** on your REST Client. Open the Basic Authorization tab:

Enter your credentials:

**Username:** Copy the API key from the Masteriyo LMS API page, and paste the key

**Password:**  Copy and paste Secret Key in the Password field

Create authorization

Now, based on the authorization provided, the user can send a request and retrieve the desired data from Masteriyo LMS Rest API.
