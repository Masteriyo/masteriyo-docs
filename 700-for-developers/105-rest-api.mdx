## Key Capabilities
Masteriyo REST API lets your application talk to your LMS system just like a messenger. You can:

- **Read Data**: Fetch course, user progress, categories, or other.  
- **Write Data**: Create or update courses, lessons, or user profiles.  
- **Delete Data**: Remove outdated content programmatically.  
- **Automate Workflows**: Sync data with CRMs, mobile apps, or other tools.  

## Setting Up API Access in Masteriyo LMS

To set up your course API access in Masteriyo LMS, follow the steps below:

### Generate API Keys

**Step 1:** From your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **Masteriyo >** **Tools > REST API**.

**Step 2:** Click the **ADD New** button, and configure details:  

- **User:** Choose a user who will own this connection. This can be anyone who has joined or created a course.  

- **Permissions:** Choose the appropriate access level:

  - **Read:** Allows viewing data  

  - **Write:** Enables data creation and modification  

  - **Read/Write:** Provides full access to view and modify data  

- **Description:** Add a meaningful description to identify this API key’s purpose so that it becomes easy to understand later when you have multiple API keys.

**Step 3:** Click on **Generate** and you’ll see a table containing:

1. An API Key (Username for authentication)

2. A Secret Key (Password)

Keep these safe as they are your access passes to the API.

**Step 4:** Manage API Keys

You can edit or delete the user from the Action tab. Simply click on the Actions menu `⋮` and perform the required action. If you’re editing, don’t forget to **Update** after you are satisfied with the changes.

## Making API Requests

### API Response Format

- **JSON**: All responses return JSON data.  

- **Dates**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (e.g., 2025-01-21 14:30:00).  

- **Prices**: Strings with 2 decimal places (e.g., "price": "50.00").  

### Authentication

To make API calls, you’ll need to set up **Basic Authentication** on your REST Client. Open the Basic Authorization tab:  

1. Enter your credentials:

    **Username:** Copy the API key from the Masteriyo LMS API page, and paste the key  

    **Password:**  Copy and paste Secret Key in the Password field  

2. Create authorization

Now, based on the authorization provided, the user can send a request and retrieve the desired data from Masteriyo LMS Rest API.

## Working with the API – Examples of Requests and Responses

Let’s look at a few examples of requests made through Masteriyo LMS REST API and the responses received.

**Note:** In the following URLs, **“your-site.com”** refers to your live LMS website address.

Here is an example of creating a course via API:

To create a new course in Masteriyo LMS using REST API, send a POST request to the following endpoint:
POST/masteriyo/v1/courses 
Example of Request:

``` bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://your-site.com/wp-json/masteriyo/v1/courses' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: Basic <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'name=Yoga&slug=yoga&status=publish&price=50'
```
Example of Response: 
```json

  "slug": "yoga",
  "permalink": "https://your-site.com/course/yoga/",
  "status": "publish",
  "price": "50",
  "formatted_price": "$50"
}
```

## Deleting Data 
Here’s an example of removing a lesson from the course.
Example of Request:
```bash 
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'https://your-site.com/wp-json/masteriyo/v1/courses/45' \

## **Troubleshooting**
| **Error Code** | **Cause**                                                                 | **Solution**                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or missing API key.                                               | Verify the API key and secret key. Ensure they are correctly entered.        |
| `403 Forbidden`    | Insufficient permissions for the API key.                                 | Regenerate the API key with the required permissions (e.g., Read/Write).    |
| `404 Not Found`    | Incorrect endpoint URL or resource does not exist.                        | Check the API documentation for valid endpoints and ensure the URL is correct. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Server-side issue (e.g., plugin conflict or misconfiguration).            | Check server logs for details. Disable conflicting plugins or contact support. |
| `400 Bad Request`  | Invalid request payload or missing required fields.                       | Validate the request body and ensure all required fields are provided.       |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded.                                                     | Reduce the frequency of API requests or implement rate limiting in your app. |

**Example Scenario**: Attempting to create a course category without proper write permissions:  
Request (cURL):
```bash 
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://your-site.com/wp-json/masteriyo/v1/courses/categories' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: Basic <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "NewCategory"
  }'
```
Response (401 Unauthorized)
```json
{
  "code": "masteriyo_rest_authentication_error",
  "message": "The API key provided does not have write permissions.",
  "data": {
    "status": 401
  }
}
```
