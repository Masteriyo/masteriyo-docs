# Setup Wizard

When you install and activate the Masteriyo plugin for the first time, you will be presented with a **Setup Wizard** screen. This setup wizard helps you to quickly setup your LMS site in few number of steps. 

Each steps are mentioned below: 
### Welcome
In this step you can either start the wizard or skip and go to your dashboard. 
- If you are using Masteriyo LMS for the first time, we strongly recommend to start the setup wizard by clicking on **Start Now** button.
- **Or**, if you are already familiar with Masteriyo LMS and don't need to run this setup wizard, you can simply skip this process by clicking on **Skip to Dashboard** button.

### Course
Few options related to Courses page will show up in this step.
- **Course Per Row**: Number of rows that you want to show in single row in courses listing page.
- **Course Per Page**: Total number of courses that you want to show in courses listing page.

### Quiz
Few options related to Quiz will show up in this step.
- **Questions Per Page**: Total number of questions that you wan to show in a single page or screen when students are taking the quiz.

### Pages
For Masteriyo LMS to run smoothly, you need to configure some pages. This steps make this configuation of pages super easy.
- **Course List**: Here, you need to select a page that will show all available courses that you have in your website.

  **Note**: By default, our setup wizard will create a new page named **Courses** and use this page as courses listing page.
- **Learning**: Here, you need to select a page that will show or run individual course when a student starts the course.

  **Note**: By default, our setup wizard will create a new page named **Learn** and use this page to run any course when a student starts it. Also, adding any content in this page itself in the dashboard is meaningless and does not show anywhere in the frontend.
