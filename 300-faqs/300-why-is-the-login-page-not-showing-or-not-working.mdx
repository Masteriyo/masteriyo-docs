If the login form is not showing on the account page, then it means that you have not added the respective shortcode on that page. 

### Adding [masteriyo_shortcode] in the account page
1. Login to your WordPress dashboard
2. Go to **Pages** and click on the **All pages** option
3. Click on the **Account** page or simply the page you are using as account page
4. Add shortcode block
5. Type shortcode **[masteriyo_account]** inside the shortcode block
6. Then, press the **Update** button

Now, this should display the login form in the account page. 
However, you need to adjust one more setting to make sure the login form works properly.
