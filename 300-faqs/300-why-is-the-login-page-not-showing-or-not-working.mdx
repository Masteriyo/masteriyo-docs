If the login form is not showing on the account page, then it means that you have not added the respective shortcode on that page. 

### Adding [masteriyo_shortcode] to the account page
1. Login to your WordPress dashboard
2. Go to **Pages** and click on the **All pages** option
3. Click on the **Account** page or simply the page you are using as the account page
4. Add shortcode block
5. Type shortcode **[masteriyo_account]** inside the shortcode block
6. Then, press the **Update** button

Now, this should display the login form on the account page. 
However, you need to adjust one more setting to make sure the login form works properly.

### Adjusting Masteriyo Global settings for the account page
1. Go to your WordPress dashboard
2. Click on **Masteriyo** -> **Settings**
4. Navigate **General** -> **Pages** -> **Account Page** drop-down option.
5. Select the account page or the page containing the account shortcode mentioned in the above section
6. Then, press the **Save Settings** button

Now, your login form on the account page should work fine.
