### How to Change the Content of Demos?

## Customizer

After importing the demo successfully, you may wish to change the content of the pages, header, footer etc. All these can be done through the Customizer. 
 
To get to the WordPress Customizer, navigate to **Appearance > Customize** from your WordPress dashboard. You will be taken directly to the Customizer interface, with your site preview on the right, and the Customizer menu on the left. From here, you can choose the options you like from Customizer. 
 
eLearning Theme provides various options to customize your site and make it look impressive. It includes the options to customize each section of the sites, which includes the header, footer, menu and a lot more.

If you want to change the content and design each of your site's pages and posts in a different way, then you can use **Page Settings** to customize them instead.

### Page Settings
Page settings allow you to change the contents and layouts of each of the site's pages. For most of the pages, you'll get the default page settings that work the same for all the pages. However, you may want the settings different from the default. This is where the individual page settings come to play. 
 
If you need to change the setting/design of the individual page, you can do so by editing that particular page and customize the page.  
 
This was done by adding a different background image to the page header of each page as instructed here: 

*```Location: WordPress Dashboard > Pages > All Pages ```*

The Page Settings option can be found in the page editor sections when editing a page. Select the **Page** which you want to customize and navigate to the **Page Settings** option available at the bottom of the selected page.

eLearning theme provides you with a number of options under Page Settings. Go through the following links below to view the page settings options in detail.

- General 
- Header 
- Primary Menu 
- Page Header

### Elementor
eLearning is compatible with almost all of the page builders. However, most of the eLearning demos are based on Elementor. In this case, you can customize the pages with Elementor.

- From your dashboard, Go to **Pages > All Pages** and Choose the required **Page** and click **Edit with Elementor**. 

**OR**

- Go to the front side of your site, choose the required **Page** and click **Edit with Elementor**.
