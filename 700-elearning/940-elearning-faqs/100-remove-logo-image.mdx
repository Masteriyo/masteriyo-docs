# How to change or remove the logo image in eLearning?

After importing one of the eLearning demos like Business, Charity, etc. changing the logo from **Customizer** wonâ€™t affect the homepage. It is due to the fact that eLearning has two ways of adding a logo. The first is using the **Customizer**, and the second is from the **Page Settings**.

The logo from the **Customizer** appears on all pages that do not have their own logo uploaded. Since the logo on the homepage of the demo comes from **Page Settings**, it overrides the logo from **Customizer**. So, you can use the **Page Settings** to change or remove the logo if you are unable to do so with the **Customizer**.

To change or remove the logo on your homepage, edit the page and then use **Page Settings**.
