### How to change the Base Colors of the site? 

    Location: Appearance > Customize > Global > Colors > Base Colors

eLearning theme allows you to change the basic color of your site. You can achieve a uniform theme color for your site using this section. It is for setting the default color that applies throughout your whole site.


     
    Note: If you want different colors for the different sections instead of the same Base Colors, you can override the base colors using the color option provided in the specific sections. For example, to choose a different text color for the Menu, go to that specific section of the Customizer and select the color. That will override whatever color has been selected as the Base Color.

#### Available Options:

- **Primary Color:** Change the primary theme color of the site.

- **Text Color:** Change the color of the text on the site. 

- **Border Color:** Change the color of the borders on the site.
