eLearning allows you to change the style and appearance of your site's content in several ways, including Typography. It allows changing the typography of different elements with the Base Typography, Site Identity, Primary Menu, Headings(H1 – H6), and Widgets under the Typography section. To change the typography of the individual section, navigate to that section and click on the edit icon of the section you choose to customize.

- From Customize section, go to the **Global > Typography**.

- In the Typography option, you will see two available options.

  - [Base Typography](https://docs.masteriyo.com/elearning/customizer[global]/typography#how-to-change-base-typography)
  
  - [Heading(H1-H6)](https://docs.masteriyo.com/elearning/customizer[global]/typography#how-to-change-the-typography-of-headings-h1-h6-)

## How to change Base Typography?

This is the default typography that applies to your whole site.

> Note: If you want different typography for the different sections instead of the same, you can override the base typography using the typography option provided in the specific sections. For example, to choose different typography for the Menu, go to that specific section of the Customizer and select the typography. That will override whatever typography has been selected as the Base Typography.

> Location: Appearance > Customize > Global > Typography > Base Typography
