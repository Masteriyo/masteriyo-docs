### How to get starter sites for eLearning Theme? 

If you are using eLearning Theme and want to import the demo content for your site, then you are at the right place. You can quickly and easily import eLearning demos with only one click. 

#### Can we import starter sites on our existing website? [IMPORTANT] 

Importing starter sites doesn’t delete your previous content. It just adds new settings and content to your site. While it only adds new content, the previous design of your site might seem to be broken. Thus, we highly recommend you to import starter sites on a fresh WordPress install.
