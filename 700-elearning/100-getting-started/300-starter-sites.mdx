### How to get starter sites for eLearning Theme? 

If you are using an eLearning theme and want to import the demo content onto your site, then you are at the right place. You can quickly and easily import eLearning demos with only one click. 

#### Can we import starter sites on our existing website? [IMPORTANT] 

Importing starter sites doesn't delete your previous content. It just adds new settings and content to your site. While it only adds new content, your site's previous design might seem broken. Thus, we highly recommend you import starter sites on a fresh WordPress install.

##### To Import a Demo in One Click 

Here's how you can quickly import the entire theme demo content and utilize the one-click demo import feature. 

- [Install and Activate the eLearning Theme](https://github.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/blob/elearning/700-elearning/100-getting-started/200-installation.mdx).

- Once you've installed and activated the eLearning theme, a notice will appear on your dashboard, prompting you to get started with the theme. 

It is shown in the image below:
