After importing the demo successfully, you may wish to change the content of the pages, header, footer etc. All these can be done through the Customizer.

If you want to change the content and design each of your site's pages and posts in a different way, then you can use Page Settings to customize them instead.

### Page Settings
Page settings allow you to change the contents and layouts of each of the site's pages. For most of the pages, you'll get the default page settings that work the same for all the pages. However, you may want the settings different from the default. This is where the individual page settings come to play. 
 
If you need to change the setting/design of the individual page, you can do so by editing that particular page and customize the page.  
 
This was done by adding a different background image to the page header of each page as instructed here: 

*```Location: WordPress Dashboard > Pages > All Pages ```*

The Page Settings option can be found in the page editor sections when editing a page. Select the Page which you want to customize and navigate to the Page Settings option available at the bottom of the selected page.

eLearning theme provides you with a number of options under Page Settings. Go through the following links below to view the page settings options in detail.
