## How to change the Site Layout?

eLearning theme allows you to change the site layout of your website.

- From Customize section, go to the **Global > Layout**.

  - Sidebar Layout

### How to manage Container?

With eLearning, you can adjust the container of your site easily using the Container Style options. Here, you will be able to select the style from a number of different choices. 

#### Available Options:

-  **Wide Container Layout**
In this layout, the width of the container is stretched wide to the fullest. Due to the wider container, the contents will also get wider and run edge to edge across the width of the browser.
