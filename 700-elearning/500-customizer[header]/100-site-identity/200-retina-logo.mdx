A Retina Logo option has been introduced in the eLearning theme, allowing users to upload a Retina (High Definition) version of the logo. This option will ensure that the logo you upload won't look blurred on high-definition screens.

To upload a Retina Logo, follow the steps mentioned below:

- From your **WordPress Dashboard**, go to the **Appearance > Customize > Header > Site Identity** section.

- Find the **Retina Logo** option. Click on Select Image and select a logo.

- Click on **Publish**.

It is shown in the image below:

> Note: Upload 2X times the size of your current logo. E.g., If your current logo size is 120*60, then upload a 240*120 sized logo.
