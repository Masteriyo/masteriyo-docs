# How to change the Site Logo?

This theme supports the default Site Identity section provided by WordPress.

## Site Identity

A Logo can be uploaded and changed to best suit your site.

- From your **WordPress Dashboard**, go to the **Appearance > Customize > Header > Site Identity** section.

- Now click on Select logo and pick a fitting logo for your site.

- If you are dissatisfied with your logo, you can use the buttons below it to Change logo or Remove it.

- Click on **Publish**.

It is shown in the image below:

```
Note: If the above process fails to change the logo of specific post or page, then its logo has already been set using Page Settings. To learn more, consult this page: How to change the logo of an individual page?
