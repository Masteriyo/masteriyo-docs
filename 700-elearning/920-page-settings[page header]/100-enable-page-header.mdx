- Choose the required **Page** you want to customize.

- Below the editor, go to the **Page Settings** option.

- Under the **Page Header** option, toggle the Enable Page Header checkbox to disable the Page Header.

> Note: After following these steps, your heading will be removed if you have selected Page Header in the Page Title option of the Customizer. Select a content area instead, and the heading will be shown in the content.
