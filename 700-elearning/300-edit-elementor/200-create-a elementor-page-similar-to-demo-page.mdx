### How to create an Elementor page similar to the demo page? 

After importing the eLearning demo to your site, you can add as many pages as you like. If you want your page to look similar to the other pages in our demo, then you can do so as well. 

Just follow the steps below:
 
- From your **WordPress Dashboard**, navigate to **Pages > Add New** and add Title to your page. 

- Go to the bottom of the page to find the **Page Settings > General** section and choose the **last option (Stretched Layout)** under **Layout**.

- Look for the **Page Attributes** section on the right side of the page, and under the Template option, choose **Page Builder**.

- Click on **Publish**.
