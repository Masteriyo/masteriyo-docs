The "Razorpay" addon by Masteriyo enables secure and seamless transactions on your site using the Razorpay payment gateway.

## Prerequisites:

1. [Masteriyo LMS Pro plan or higher](https://docs.masteriyo.com/getting-started/installation).
2. [Active installation of Masteriyo LMS](https://docs.masteriyo.com/getting-started/installation#installing-masteriyo-lms-pro-version).
3. [Activate the RazorPay Integration add-on](https://docs.masteriyo.com/getting-started/activate-masteriyo-addons).

## Configuration

### Getting Credentials from Razorpay

In order to integrate Razorpay, you will need Live/Test Publishable and Secret keys. To generate the Publishable and Secret keys in Razorpay, you need to follow these steps:

1. Log in to your **Razorpay Dashboard** using your credentials.
2. Once you are logged in, navigate to the **Settings** section.
3. In the Settings section, click on **API Keys**.

4. On the API Keys page, you will see two sections: **Test Mode and Live Mode**.
- **Test Mode**: This mode is used for testing your integration without making actual transactions. The keys generated in this mode will not process real payments.
- **Live Mode**: This mode is used for accepting real payments from your customers. The keys generated in this mode will process actual transactions.
5. Click on the Generate Key button in the respective mode (Test or Live) for which you want to generate the keys.
6. A pop-up window will appear with your Publishable Key and Secret Key.

- The **Publishable Key** is used on the client-side (such as in your website or mobile app) to securely communicate with Razorpay.
- The **Secret Key** is used on the server-side to authenticate and authorize requests made to Razorpay's API.
7. You can click on the Copy button to copy the keys to your clipboard or click on the Download Key Details button to save the keys on your device.
8. Make sure to securely store your Secret Key and never share it with anyone or expose it in your client-side code.

It is important to note that the Secret Key should never be shared publicly or exposed in client-side code, as it can pose a security risk to your Razorpay account. Only the Publishable Key should be used on the client-side.

Once you have generated the required keys, you will have to add these keys in the following location.

        Masteriyo > Settings > Payments > Razorpay
