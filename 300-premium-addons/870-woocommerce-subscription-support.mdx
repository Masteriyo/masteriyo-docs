## Configuration

**Create a Recurring/Subscription based course**

**Create a WooCommerce product based on above course**

Now, you will need to create a WC product based on the above course. For this, go to **Products > Add New**.

        Make sure the product description like name and pricing is similar to the course you are basing this product with. 

On the Product Data box, you will need to select **Masteriyo Course** as the **Product Type**.

You will see the options related to Masteriyo Course on the Product Data box. Select the course you have created/edited on the first step.

After this, on the **General** Tab, set the pricing and subscription as per the course. Make sure the pricing and the time period is exact to the course.
