Drip Content is a powerful feature that allows you to release course materials to your learners over a set period of time. By integrating Drip Content into your LMS plugin, you can easily schedule the release of content and assessments, providing a more structured and organized learning experience for your students. 
This documentation will guide you through the process of integrating Drip Content into your LMS plugin.


### How to Use?

1. Install [Masteriyo Pro](https://docs.masteriyo.com/getting-started/activate-masteriyo-addons)
2. Enable the [Content Drip Add-on](https://docs.masteriyo.com/getting-started/activate-masteriyo-addons)

### Setup and Configuration

Once you have installed and activated the required plugin and add-on, follow the steps below.

1. Go to Courses and select the desired course.
2. Select the desired course and click on **Edit**.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Content Drip**.
4. Select the desired Content Drip option for your **lesson/quiz**.
5. You can select any one out of the four available options from the **Content Drip settings**.

These options determine the flow of the lessons/quiz in your courses. The available options are described in detail below.


#### Free: 

Choosing this option means that the flow of the content is random. The users can jump from the first lesson/quiz, letâ€™s say last, without completing the courses in the middle. 

#### Sequential: 

Unlike the Free option, this option sets a sequential rule for your lesson/quiz. Now the users will have to complete the first lesson/quiz to move forward to move forward to the next lesson/quiz. 

The locked lessons/quiz will appear as:

#### Date Selection:

You can choose this option to unlock the lessons/quiz on a particular date and onwards. 
1. The data can be set from **Builder** > **Lesson/Quiz**. 
2. **Click** on the edit icon for the desired lesson/quiz.
3. Select the desired date at the Drip Date option, and the lesson will only be unlocked on that particular date and onwards. 

The locked lesson will be shown as:

This option lets you choose to unlock the lessons/quiz after a number of days from enrollment. 
1. The days are also set at **Builder** > **Lesson/Quiz**. 
2. **Click** on the edit icon for the desired lesson/quiz.
3. Enter the number of days on the Drip Days option, and the lesson will be unlocked after those many days of enrollment. 

The locked lessons/quizes will be shown below:
