You can set the grades you have created to assignments and courses. Once the users attempt the quiz or completes assignment, they will be graded as per the points, percentage. You can view these results in the Results tab. Note that the assignments require review. Therefore, they must be reviewed in order to appear on the Results tab. Same goes for the quizzes that require review. First of all, you will need to set weight for quiz and assignment to provide grading for the users.

#### How to assign course and assignment weight?

In order to grade any user based on their quiz attempt and assignment, you will need to set weight for the quiz and assignment respectively. This can be done from the individual quiz/assignment settings.

Navigate to **Masteriyo > Courses > Select Course > Builder > Select Quiz/Assignment > Settings**.

Here, you will find the option to set Quiz/Assignment weight in the General tab.
