The "Public Profile" addon by Masteriyo provides instructors or students with a public profile page visible to others.

## Setup

1. Install [Masteriyo Pro](https://docs.masteriyo.com/getting-started/installation#installing-masteriyo-lms-pro-version)
2. Activate the [Public Profile](https://woo.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)

## Configuration

To configure Public Profile, go to the following location.

        Masteriyo > Settings > Advanced > Public Profile

![enable-public-profile](https://github.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/assets/75772539/59eec6b6-2fd3-4954-9712-27e3860c6942)

Here, you can give a slug to the profile page as per your desire.

        Note: If you leave this space empty, 'default' will be the default slug.

Once you have given the slug and saved settings, the public profile URL will look like this:

        https://example.com/slug/username

If you visit this URL, you will see the profile of the desired instructors or students.
