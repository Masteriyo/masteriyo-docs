### Hosting Requirements

Masteriyo LMS performs best on a **dedicated hosting environment** with adequate server resources (CPU, RAM, and storage).

We do **not recommend shared hosting**, including:

* **Standard shared hosting**
* **Budget or entry-level shared plans**
* **Shared hosting with aggressive server-level caching** (such as LiteSpeed-based shared hosting)

These hosting types can cause **slow performance** and **cache-related issues**, especially for dynamic features like lessons and quizzes.

Please make sure your hosting server meets the **minimum WordPress requirements**:

For the best experience, we recommend hosting that provides **full control over server-level caching** or uses modern setups such as **Nginx or Apache**.
