4. Using WordPress **Tools > Site Health** in your admin dashboard

## SSL Certificate

- **Required** for processing payments securely
- **Recommended** for all production sites
- Most hosting providers offer free SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt

## Browser Compatibility

Masteriyo LMS frontend is compatible with modern browsers:

### Desktop Browsers

- Google Chrome (Latest 2 versions)
- Mozilla Firefox (Latest 2 versions)
- Safari (Latest 2 versions)
- Microsoft Edge (Latest 2 versions)

> **Note:** Internet Explorer is not supported. We recommend users upgrade to a modern browser for the best experience.

## Hosting Recommendations

Masteriyo LMS performs best on a **dedicated hosting environment** with adequate server resources (CPU, RAM, and storage).

We do **not recommend shared hosting**, including:

- **Standard shared hosting**
- **Budget or entry-level shared plans**
- **Shared hosting with aggressive server-level caching** (such as LiteSpeed-based shared hosting)

These hosting types can cause **slow performance** and **cache-related issues**, especially for dynamic features like lessons and quizzes.

Please make sure your hosting server meets the **minimum WordPress requirements**:
[https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/)

For the best experience, we recommend hosting that provides **full control over server-level caching** or uses modern setups such as **Nginx or Apache**.

### Shared Hosting

For small to medium-sized course sites (up to 1,000 students):

- 2GB RAM minimum
- SSD storage
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Regular backups

### VPS or Dedicated Hosting

For larger course platforms (1,000+ students):

- 4GB+ RAM
- SSD storage
- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Object caching (Redis/Memcached)
- CDN integration
- Regular automated backups

## Additional Requirements

### For Payment Processing

When using payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Mollie, etc.):

- Valid SSL certificate (HTTPS)
- API credentials from payment provider
- Webhook support enabled
- cURL and OpenSSL extensions

### For Video Hosting

Masteriyo supports multiple video hosting options:

- **YouTube** - Free, unlimited storage
- **Vimeo** - Privacy controls, better video quality
- **Self-hosted** - Complete control, requires adequate server storage and bandwidth
- **Third-party CDN** - For large-scale video delivery

### For Email Notifications

- SMTP server configuration recommended
- Plugins like [Smart SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-smtp/) or similar
- Valid SPF and DKIM records for deliverability

### For Third-Party Integrations

Depending on which features you use, you may need:

- **Zoom** - API credentials for live class integration
- **Google Meet** - OAuth credentials for meeting integration
- **OpenAI** - API key for ChatGPT features
- **Page Builders** - Elementor, Divi, Oxygen, or Bricks (if using their integrations)

## Known Compatibility Issues

### Server Configurations

- **ModSecurity** - May block legitimate requests; whitelist Masteriyo endpoints if needed
- **Cloudflare** - Ensure "Always Online" doesn't cache dynamic content
- **Aggressive caching** - Exclude learn, checkout and account pages from caching

### Plugin Conflicts

While Masteriyo is designed to work with most plugins, conflicts may occur with:

- Aggressive security plugins (may block REST API)
- Caching plugins with improper configuration
- Page builders with JavaScript conflicts

> **Tip:** Always test plugin compatibility in a staging environment before deploying to production.

## Checking Compatibility

Before installing Masteriyo LMS, you can:

1. Review your server's PHP version in **WordPress > Tools > Site Health**
2. Contact your hosting provider to verify requirements
3. Use a staging environment to test installation
4. Check plugin compatibility with your current setup
