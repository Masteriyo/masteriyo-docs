# How to create a Quiz?

With Masteriyo, you can create advanced quizzes as per your needs. There is a component in the course section called quiz where you can add questions and allow users to answer them. You can assign points to these questions, set a pass mark and check the student's progress.


- Navigate to the course builder of the course where you want to create a quiz. Now, click on **Add New Content**.

![Click on Add New Content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/advanced-quiz-creation/click-on-add-new-content.png)

- Select content type as **Quiz**. 

![Add New Quiz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/advanced-quiz-creation/click-on-quiz-creation.png)

A new interface for adding a quiz will be shown.

- Give a name and description to the Quiz.
- Click on **Next**.

![Add name and description to Quiz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/advanced-quiz-creation/add-name-and-description-to-quiz.png)

Now, you'll get two options:

![Add New Question or Add From Question Bank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/advanced-quiz-creation/add-new-question.png)

## Add from Question Bank (New)

The question bank is a centralized repository for Masteriyo LMS, where you can find existing questions created with your LMS. Click on this option, and a new interface will pop up showing you all the existing questions. From here, you can choose the existing quiz's questions and add them to your course without recreating.

You can choose your preferred action:

**Add to Quiz:** Adds the question directly (removes it from the bank).  

![Add to Quiz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/advanced-quiz-creation/add-to-quiz-button.png)

**Duplicate and Add to Quiz:** Creates a copy and adds it to your quiz while keeping the original in the bank.

![select-quiz-and-or-duplicate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/advanced-quiz-creation/duplicate-and-add-to-quiz.png)

Now, if you want to reuse any of those, you can select and click on **Add Selected** and then hit the **Update** button. It will now automatically add those questions to your quiz.
