![quiz-question-type-single-choice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/441f8e99-0495-4318-9b9b-589d27731fe8)

If you have questions where the learners have to select only one question out of the available options, you need to add this question type. Click on 'Add new answer' to add a new option.

### MultiChoice

![quiz-question-type-multiple-choice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8916b05d-3264-44cd-b1e8-8097546cfc77)

This is similar to the single-choice questions, but here the learners can select more than one answer. Click on 'Add new answer' to add a new option.

### Text Answer [Pro]

![Text Answer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c166a17-dfe8-4ae0-92eb-64ff4b25e14c)

This question type lets you create a question that requires explanatory text answers. It lets the learners describe the answer in their own words. You can set the maximum length for the text.

### Match the following [Pro]

![match-the-following](https://github.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/assets/75772539/5c3be922-c38f-4e10-80bc-25fbe732bf33)

This is a question type where the answers are to be matched with the prompts. You can select whether you are matching text to text, image to text or image to image.

        When you select any options related to image, you can upload your image from the uploader button.

![matchthefollowing-image-upload](https://github.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/assets/75772539/bf88b71a-a871-48ca-ac6b-2ae2b5945a43)

While submitting the quiz, the learners should select the matching answers for the respective prompts from the drop-down menu. You can see it in the image below.

Here, you can upload videos while creating courses and give questions related to that videos. There are four video sources you can choose from. They are:

- Self Hosted

In the Self-Hosted option, you will need to upload a video from the local source. Similarly, if you choose Youtube or Vimeo, you can add Youtube or Vimeo video links. The last one is the external URL. You can add the URL of the place where you have hosted your own video.

Now, while submitting the quiz, the learners can watch the video and write the answer to the question asked.
