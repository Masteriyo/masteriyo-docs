#### Select Timestamps    
You can also create interactive timestamps for your audio. To add timestamps:  
1.	Play the audio and note key moments with time
2.	You’ll see a blue slider with two timestamp markers
3.	Slide the timestamp marker to select a specific time range of the audio 
4.	Give **Title Name** to the timestamp range and click on **Add** to save the timestamp
5.	Repeat this until you give a proper timestamp name to the whole audio lesson

You can also easily edit or delete the audio lesson once it is created. 

**Lesson Description:** Add a description to your audio lesson here. You can provide content, objectives, or any other materials from here.
