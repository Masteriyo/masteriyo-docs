- Navigate to **Builder** tab and click on **Add New Section** button.

  Set a one-time fee for the course you have created. 

![Pricing for Paid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/course-creation/paid-pricing-option.png)

The enrollers must then pay this amount to take the course. You can also add a sale price so that the course will display both the original price and the sale price. 

- **Recurring** [Pro]  

  Recurring creates a subscription-based course where students pay repeatedly at set intervals to maintain access.
