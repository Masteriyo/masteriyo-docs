### Adding Live Stream Lesson

#### Add Lesson Details

**Lesson Name** - Enter the title of your lesson in the "Your Lesson Name" field.

#### Add Video URL

You can add your live stream link in the **Video URL** field. For example, if you live stream on YouTube, you can directly add the YouTube video link. Alternatively, you can use a Video URL from another platform where the video is already hosted and present it as a live stream.

  - **Start Time**: Set the start time for the live stream.
  - **End Time**: Set the end time for the live stream.
  
#### Add Lesson Description

Use the editor to write a detailed description of the lesson. You can type directly or use the **+/Block** option to add content blocks, such as text, images, or other elements. Formatting options are available in the toolbar above the editor (e.g., bold, alignment, etc.).

#### Configure Video Settings

On the right-hand panel, you can adjust the following settings:
- **Enable Video Share**: Toggle this option to allow or restrict video sharing.
- **Enable Right Click**: Enable or disable right-click functionality on the video.
- **Enable Live Chat**: Enable or disable the live chat feature during the live streaming.
- **Enable Lesson Preview [Pro]**: Toggle the **Enable Lesson Preview** option if you want to allow students to preview the lesson before enrolling.    
- **Transform live stream to video**: Toggle the option to convert the Live Stream to normal video so that users can access the video after the live session ends.  

Meanwhile, you need to configure **Player** settings with YouTube API keys before you can transform a live stream into a normal video lesson. So, on your new tab, navigate to **Masteriyo > Settings > General > Player**.     
Now, paste your **YouTube API** key under the API keys and click on **Save Setting**.

For a detailed YouTube API key setup guide, visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). 

#### Add a Featured Image

Click the **Add Featured Image** button on the right panel to upload an image visually representing the lesson.

#### Save or Publish

At the bottom of the page, choose one of the following options:
- **Publish**: Make the lesson live and accessible to users.
- **Save to Draft**: Save your changes as a draft for later editing.
- **Cancel**: Discard changes.
