Masteriyo provides individual course reports. To access a report for each course, including student activity and progress, go to your Dashboard > Masteriyo > Courses. Click the three dots next to a course, then select the "Reports" button. This will show advanced analytics for that course, including sales, enrollment, and student progress.

### Student's Progress
