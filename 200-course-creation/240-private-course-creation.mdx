The Private Course feature in Masteriyo LMS allows you to create exclusive courses only accessible to manually enrolled students. Unlike public classes, these remain hidden from your course catalog and require you to invite students personally.  

## Prerequisites:
- [Masteriyo LMS Pro plan or higher](https://masteriyo.com/pricing/)(**Plugin version 2.21.0** or above).  
- Active [installation of Masteriyo LMS](https://docs.masteriyo.com/getting-started/installation#installing-masteriyo-lms-pro-version).
- **Manual Enrollment addon** (included with Pro plan).   

## Create a New Private Course 
You have two options for creating private courses: starting fresh or converting an existing course. So, let’s begin by setting up a new course with private access from the start.  

- Navigate to **Masteriyo > Courses**. 
- Click **Add New Course**. 
- Fill in your course details (name, description, highlights, etc.)   

For a detailed guide, check out the [guide on creating a complete course](https://docs.masteriyo.com/course-creation/complete-course-creation). 

- Click the dropdown arrow next to the **Publish** button.

- Select **Switch To Private** from the options.

That’s it. Now, you can navigate to **Course Builder** to configure the course with [lessons](https://docs.masteriyo.com/course-creation/text-lesson-creation), [quizzes](https://docs.masteriyo.com/course-creation/advanced-quiz-creation), and so on.

## Enrolling Students in Private Courses

### Enable Manual Enrollment Addon
1. Navigate to **Masteriyo > Addons** and search for **Manual Enrollment**.   
2. Toggle the switch to enable the addon.
