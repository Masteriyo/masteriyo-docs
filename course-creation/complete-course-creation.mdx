### Creating a Course

* On the right-hand side, enter the main features of the course in the **Course Highlights** box. You can enter the main highlighted features of the course in bullet points. Course highlights will be shown on the course listing page.
* Just below the Course Highlight comes the **Categories**. You can select a category from the dropdown if you already have a category. If not, you can create a new one by clicking on **Add New Category**.

* Click **Next** button on the top right corner to go to the next interface which is a **Builder** area.

You can simply click the publish button, and it will publish the course but without any content. So let's add some content to the course.

### Adding New Section
Each course can be divided into **sections**. Sections are nothing but  a group of **Lessons**. Grouping lessons into different sections is an excellent way to make a course easier to navigate and give your student a quick overview.
* Click **Add New Section** in the builder area.
