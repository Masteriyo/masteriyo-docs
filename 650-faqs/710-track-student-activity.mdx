The Track Student Activity feature in the Masteriyo LMS plugin helps monitor student engagement by tracking important details like how long students spend in Lessions, their quiz attempts, and assignment submissions. It collects this data to help educators better understand student performance and improve learning results.

The **Track Student Activity** option includes two key settings to ensure accurate monitoring and reporting of user activity:

- **Server Sync Interval Duration** - This setting controls how often the system updates user activity data to the server. The time is measured in minutes, and the default is 5 minutes. For example, if it is set to 5 minutes, the LMS will send updated activity data to the server every 5 minutes. This helps with near real-time tracking and reduces the chances of data loss.

- **Idle Time Threshold** - 
This setting decides how long a student can be inactive before their session is marked as idle. The default time is 30 minutes. If the student doesn't click or do anything for 30 minutes, their session will be marked idle. This helps teachers know if the student is active or just logged in.

These options ensure accurate activity tracking and provide valuable insights into student engagement.
