The Track Student Activity feature in the Masteriyo LMS plugin helps monitor student engagement by tracking important details like how long students spend in sessions, their quiz attempts, and assignment submissions. It collects this data to help educators better understand student performance and improve learning results.

The **Track Student Activity** option includes two key settings to ensure accurate monitoring and reporting of user activity:

- **Server Sync Interval Duration** - This setting controls how often the system updates user activity data to the server. The time is measured in minutes, and the default is 5 minutes. For example, if it is set to 5 minutes, the LMS will send updated activity data to the server every 5 minutes. This helps with near real-time tracking and reduces the chances of data loss.

- **Idle Time Threshold** - This setting decides how long a student can stay inactive before their session is marked as idle. The time is measured in minutes, with the default set to 30 minutes. For example, the system marks the session as idle if no action (like clicking or navigating) happens within 30 minutes. This helps educators tell the difference between active participation and just being logged in.

These options ensure accurate activity tracking and provide valuable insights into student engagement.
