Masteriyo is a React-based advanced LMS plugin. You may occasionally experience issues accessing courses because of other external caches. <br>
Masteriyo provides an inbuilt feature to clear those caches. It improves course access by removing temporary glitches, such as duplicate enrollments, caused by website caching.<br> 
This ensures that your course list is up-to-date and error-free.

To clear the cache, follow the steps below:

1. Please log in to your site's WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to **Masteriyo -> Tools -> Utilities**.
3. Click on **Clear Cache**.
