## Mastriyo Account page error.

If you log in to the Masteriyo Account Page with roles like editor, subscriber, or contributor, you will see this error message:

![Permisson issue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16b1e990-e3f0-4db7-885d-0f0e49917a71)


This denotes that users can view the Account page only with specific user roles. These roles are mentioned below.

1. **Masteriyo Student** - If you are a student, you will be provided access to the account page where you can view your courses and progress.
2. **Masteriyo Instructor** - You can also access the Masteriyo account page as an instructor.
3. **Admin** - As an admin of the site, you can also access the Masteriyo account page.

If you have WooCommerce on your site and have enabled the Masteriyo WooCommerce Integration add-on, the following roles can also access the account page:

1. **Shop Manager**
2. **Customer**

If you are trying to access your Dashboard >> Masteriyo >> any settings or options and see the message "Sorry, you are not allowed to read resources" or "TypeError I roles. Includes is not a function," this is likely a permission issue. A third-party plugin may be customizing the admin or instructor roles. Please check if a plugin is overriding these roles.
