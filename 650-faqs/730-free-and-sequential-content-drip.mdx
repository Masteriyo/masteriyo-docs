Drip Content refers to how course content are made available to learners over time. With Masteriyo LMS, you can set the Free or Sequential flow of course content for each course.

#### Free: 

Choosing this option means that the flow of the content is random. The users can jump from the first lesson/quiz, letâ€™s say last, without completing the courses in the middle. 

#### Sequential: 

Unlike the Free option, this option sets a sequential rule for your lesson/quiz. Now, the users will have to complete the first lesson/quiz to move forward to move forward to the next lesson/quiz. 

The locked lessons/quiz will appear as:
