It's possible that you may encounter an error message when attempting to log into the account page of the Materiyo plugin.

This denotes that you are trying to log in to the Materiyo account as a user that doesnâ€™t have the following user roles.

1. **Masteriyo Student** - If you are a student, you will be provided an access to the account page where you can view your courses and progresses.
2. **Masteriyo Instructor** - You can also access the Masteriyo account page as an instructor.
3. **Admin** - As an admin of the site, you can also access the Masteriyo account page.

Now, if you have WooCommerce on your site and have enabled the Masteriyo WooCommerce Integration add-on, there are certain other user roles that can access the account page. They are:

1. **Shop Manager**
2. **Customer**
