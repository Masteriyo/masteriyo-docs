## Admin Dashboard > Masteriyo error.

If you are trying to access your Dashboard >> Masteriyo >> any settings or options and see the message "Sorry, you are not allowed to read resources," this is likely a permission issue. A third-party plugin may be customizing the admin or instructor roles. Please check if a plugin is overriding these roles.
