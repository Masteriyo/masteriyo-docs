Conflict on WordPress sites occurs when plugin and theme functions and resources create problems. The problem can be a design issue or a critical issue (which makes your site down). If the designs or some features are not working on your site, you must do the plugin/ theme conflict test.
 
### How To Check Theme Conflict?
 
If your theme is custom-made or not updated, this may cause a conflict on your site. And to test theme conflict;
 
1. Login to your dashboard, navigate **Appearance**->**Themes**
2. Activate default themes like **Twenty Twenty**, **Twenty Twenty-One**, **Twenty Twenty-Two**
3. Check to see if the issue still exists or not
 
If the issue didn't occur after activating a default theme, then your theme is causing a conflict, so contact theme developers or us. If the problem continues, you should then test plugin conflicts.
 
### How To Check Plugin Conflict?
 
To test plugin conflict, we strongly recommend using  **Health Check & Troubleshooting plugin** instead of deactivating and activating the plugin manually.

#### Health Check & Troubleshooting plugin [Recommended] 
1. Install  [Health Check & Troubleshooting](https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check)
2. Enable the **Troubleshooting mode**, starting with only Masteriyo enabled
3. Enable the other plugins one after another and check your issue on the incognito browser
4. Once you have identified the conflict, you can Disable the Troubleshoot mode. It will make your site back to normal. And report the conflict to the developers of the plugin or our support team

  **Note:** Troubleshooting Mode does not affect your site visitors; they will continue to view your site as usual.

#### Activating/ Deactivating Plugin Manually

1. Deactivate all plugins except the **Masteriyo**
2. Check the site to see if the issue still exists. If the problem is still occurring, contact our Support Team. If the issue is not displaying, then conflict is happening due to other plugins.
3. Activate the plugins one by one until you find the plugin that causes the issue
4. Once you have identified the plugin causing the conflict, report the conflict to the plugin developers and us.

  **Note:** Always use caution while testing for conflicts on a live website. A backup is advised before you start.
