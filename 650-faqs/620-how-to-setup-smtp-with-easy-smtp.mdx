### Configuration of the SMTP

- **From Email Address:** You need to enter the email address that you use to send the email notifications.

- **From Name:** You need to enter the Sender name which will be displayed to the recipients with the emails.

- **SMTP Host:** Here, you need to enter the address of the host’s SMTP server or, the outgoing mail server (example: smtp.your-site.com)

- **Type of Encryption:** There are three options here for you to choose: none, SSL/TLS and STARTTLS. SSL and TLS are widely used and they are used with different ports: 465 and 587 respectively.

- **SMTP Port:** Enter the port that will be used to relay outbound mail to your mail server. The most common ports are 587 and 465 but, you need to check with your hosting provider if these ports are open.

- **SMTP Authentication:** This option should always be checked “Yes” as popular email providers require authentication.

- **Username:** Enter the username for SMTP mail server (example: abc123@gmail.com)

- **Password:** Enter the password for the SMTP mail server

Once you are done with the settings, you can Save Changes.
