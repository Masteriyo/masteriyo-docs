Basically, you need to create **an order** to provide access of any course to a student.<br />
So, please follow the steps below to do so.

1. Please login to your site's WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to **Masteriyo -> Orders**.
3. Click on **Create New Order** button.
4. For the **Status** dropdown option, please select the **Completed** option.
5. For the **Customer** option, please find the student that you want to provide the course to and select that student.
6. For the **Course** option, please find the course that you want the student have access to and select that course.
7. Click on the **Create Order** button and that's it.

Now, once the student logins to his/her account and visits the course page for which the access was provided, should be able to enroll the course.

<callout> **Note**: The student should already be registered to the site so that any paid course can be assigned to that student. </callout>
