### 1. Certificate Add-On Not Visible in Masteriyo

**Question: ** I have enabled the certificate add-on, but it does not appear as an option in Masteriyo. What should I do?

**Answer: ** If you encounter this issue, it is possible that the resource did not load correctly due to permission conflicts. We suggest performing the following steps to resolve the problem:

- Navigate to the Dashboard -> Plugins.
- Deactivate the Masteriyo Pro Plugin.
- Wait for a few moments, and then reactivate the plugin.

This process can help refresh the system's permissions, allowing the certificate option to load properly. If the issue persists, please reach out to Masteriyo support for further assistance.

### 2. Certificate Background Not Displaying

**Question: ** Why is the background or image not showing when I preview the certificate?

**Answer: ** The inability to view the background or images on your certificate typically stems from a server-side configuration issue, specifically, the PHP image extension GD2 being disabled. To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:

- Contact your hosting provider's support team.
- Request that they enable the PHP image extension GD2 on your site.

Enabling the GD2 extension is crucial for image processing and rendering on your website, including the proper display of certificate backgrounds. If you're unsure how to contact your hosting provider or if the problem persists after the GD2 extension is enabled, please consult the documentation provided by your hosting service or reach out to their support for further guidance.
