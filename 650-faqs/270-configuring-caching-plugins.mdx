- **Learn**  
- **Courses**  
- **Checkout**

Below, you will find the instruction to remove these pages from the cache for a few top caching plugins.

## WP Rocket

We suggest you to avoid JS files minification from the **WP Rocket** -> **Settings** -> **File Optimization**.

You can also use an alternative method for avoiding the desired pages from cache. This method also helps you to add bulk URLs for multiple pages.
For this, go to **Settings** -> **WP Rocket** -> **Advanced Rules**. Add the desired page URLs on the **Never Cache URLs** input option.
