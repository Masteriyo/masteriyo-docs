Below, you will find the instruction to remove these pages from the cache for a few top caching plugins.

## WP Rocket

The Masteriyo plugin is compatible with the WP Rocket. Please make sure that the above-mentioned pages are excluded from the cache.  
For this, navigate to **Dashboard** -> **Pages** -> **Account** -> Check on **Never cache this page** on the WP Rocket Sidebar Menu.

We suggest you to avoid JS files minification from the **WP Rocket** -> **Settings** -> **File Optimization**.

You can also use an alternative method for avoiding the desired pages from cache. This method also helps you to add bulk URLs for multiple pages.
For this, go to **Settings** -> **WP Rocket** -> **Advanced Rules**. Add the desired page URLs on the **Never Cache URLs** input option.

## Excluding Masteriyo Session From The Cache

If the caching system youâ€™re using offers database caching, it might be helpful to exclude `masteriyo_sessions` from being cached. This will be dependent on the plugin or host caching so refer to the specific instructions or docs for that system.
