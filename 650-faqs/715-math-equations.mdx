## Math Essentials: Syntax and Delimiters

Read the following information to learn how math equations can be used in lessons, quizzes, and assignments. 

### In-line Math Delimiters

Use these for math expressions that appear within a line of text.

### Displayed Equations

Use these for math equations that need to appear on a separate line.

### Prevent Dollar Sign as Delimiter

To show a dollar sign without triggering math mode, use this syntax.

### Processing Environments

MathJax can process everything inside these delimiters, even for cases where true LaTeX might not.

### Matrix Environment

MathJax can render this syntax even without math delimiters, but it is better to use delimiters.
