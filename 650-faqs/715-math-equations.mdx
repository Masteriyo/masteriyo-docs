Masteriyo LMS allows you to use Math Equations in lessons, quizzes, and assignment editors. This feature works with both the classic and block editors.

## Math Essentials: Syntax and Delimiters

Please read the following information to learn how math equations can be used in lessons, quizzes, and assignments. 

### In-line Math Delimiters

Use these for math expressions that appear within a line of text.

Syntax: \(...\) or $...$
Example: \( x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \) or $ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $

### Displayed Equations

Use these for math equations that need to appear on a separate line.

Syntax: \[...\] or $$...$$
Example: \[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \] or $$ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $$

### Prevent Dollar Sign as Delimiter

To show a dollar sign without triggering math mode, use this syntax.

Syntax: \$
Example: To display $5, use \$

### Processing Environments

MathJax can process everything inside these delimiters, even for cases where true LaTeX might not.

Syntax: \begin{equation}...\end{equation}
Example: \begin{equation} E = mc^2 \end{equation}

### Matrix Environment

MathJax can render this syntax even without math delimiters, but it is better to use delimiters.

Syntax: \begin{matrix}...\end{matrix}
Example: \begin{matrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix}

### Additional Configuration
