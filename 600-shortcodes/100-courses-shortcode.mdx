### Courses Shortcode

With the help of this shortcode you can show a list of courses anywhere in your site as you like.

The default shortcode is: `[masteriyo_courses]`

<br />
This will display all the free and premium courses in 3 columns format. It will show
12 courses if available in total by default.{" "}

However, there are more attributes via which you will have some control on what set of courses you want to show.

#### Attributes

1. **Category**: Default value is `none`. You can add the slug of any course and it will show the courses of that particular slug.
2. **Columns**: Default value is `3`. You can choose the columns value ranging from **1** to **4**, as Masteriyo supports upto 4 columns while showing the courses.
3. **Count**: Default value is `12`. You can set any number as you like and it will show that number of courses.
