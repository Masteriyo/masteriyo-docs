### Courses Shortcode
With the help of this shortcode you can show a list of courses anywhere in your site as you like. 

The default shortcode is: `[masteriyo_courses]`
<br/>This will display all the free and premium courses in 3 columns format.
It will show 12 courses if available in total by default. 

However, there are more attributes via which you will have some control on what set of courses you want to show.

2. **Columns**: Defaut value is `3`. You can choose the columns value ranging from **1** to **4**, as Masteriyo supports upto 4 columns while showing the courses.
