### Courses Shortcode

This shortcode allows you to display student registration forms anywhere on your site.

The default shortcode is: `[masteriyo_student_registration]`

You can use this shortcode on your page or in specific sections to display the student registration form. Once you insert the shortcode, the registration form will appear, as shown in the screenshot below.
