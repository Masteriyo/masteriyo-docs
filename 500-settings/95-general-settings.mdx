This feature, also known as Masteriyo Player, allows you to turn the player on or off for YouTube and Vimeo videos you've uploaded. You can choose to require students to watch the full video, preventing them from skipping, and set a specific seek time.

**In the premium version**, you can activate the note system, set a Video Completion Percentage, which ensures students watch the video based on the percentage you define in the player settings, and display your brand logo on the videos.

Please note that you can change the brand logo using the White Label addon.
