#### Tax Calculation Method Choose 
From here, you can determine how taxes should be calculated for your courses: 

![Choose tax calculation method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/payments/tax-calculation-method.png)

**Option 1**: Prices Include Tax  

Course prices already include tax, as the tax amount is extracted from the total cost. It’s useful when selling to a single tax jurisdiction because it’s simpler for fixed-rate scenarios.

![Display Tax Inclusive Price](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/payments/price-include-tax.png)

**Option 2**: Calculate Tax at Checkout   

Tax is calculated during checkout, based on the customer's billing address. It’s more accurate for international sales.

#### Price Display Options 
**Configure Tax-Inclusive Display**: Check **"Display tax-inclusive prices"** if you want to show prices with tax included.
