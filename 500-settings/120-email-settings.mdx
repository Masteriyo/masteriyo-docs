More Options for Masteriyo LMS Premium Users
As a Masteriyo Pro user, you can fully customize email notifications for administrators, instructors, and students. You can also preview templates before sending them. For each email setting, you’ll get the Edit and Preview feature. Here’s how to use them:
Edit Email Templates
You can click on the Edit button and edit the following information:
To Address: Override the default recipient (e.g., use support@yoursite.com). You can enter multiple email addresses here by separating them with commas. 
From Name: Customize the sender’s display name from here.
From Address: You can set a dedicated sender email from here.
Reply To Name: Enter the name to display as the reply-to name when the recipient replies to your email.
Reply To Address: Define where replies should go
Subject: Write a clear, engaging subject line 
Content: Use the editor to format text, add images, insert mathematical syntax, and more from here. You can also add Smart Tags to the content. They’re the dynamic placeholders that auto-populate email with specific data. 
In the content editor, place your cursor where you want to add Smart Tag. Next, click the Add Smart Tags button to display a list of available tags. Select an appropriate tag to add to your content. 
For example, in the first line, if you want to auto-populate an email with the receiver’s name that is available through their billing name, you can use {billing_first_name} smart tag.
Preview Emails
To see how the email looks on the user’s end, click the Preview button. The preview includes content along with your Template Logo, Header Background, and Footer Text from General Settings.
Resetting to Default
If you feel you overwrote a template, you can always return to the original content. Click Reset to Default, and the original content and settings will be restored.
