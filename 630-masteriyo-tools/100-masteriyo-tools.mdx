You can import or export courses from here. You will need the courses to be in JSON format for importing.

You can upload the JSON file from the upload button and click on Import Courses button. The courses will thus be imported and will be available at **Masteriyo > Courses**.
Similarly, just click on the Export Courses button and you can download the available courses in a JSON file.
