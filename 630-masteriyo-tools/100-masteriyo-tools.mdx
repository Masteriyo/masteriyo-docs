## Import/export

![import/export](https://github.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/assets/75772539/7187f4a7-6d03-4861-9819-cea6ec5e17ec)

You can import or export courses from here. You will need the courses to be in JSON format for importing.

You can upload the JSON file from the upload button and click on Import Courses button. The courses will thus be imported and will be available at **Masteriyo > Courses**.
Similarly, just click on the Export Courses button and you can download the available courses in a JSON file.

## Sample Courses

Using this feature, you can install sample courses created by our team into your site. This will help you understand how to create a course in a elegant manner. Choose either you want the courses to be directly published or stay as drafts and then click on Install button.

Once the installation is completed, you can find the installed courses at Masteriyo > Courses
