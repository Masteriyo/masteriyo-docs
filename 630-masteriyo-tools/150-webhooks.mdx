**Webhooks** are a powerful feature in Masteriyo that enables real-time communication between your WordPress LMS and external applications. This documentation covers both types of webhook functionality available in Masteriyo:

**Trigger Webhooks (Outgoing)**: Send data from Masteriyo to external applications when specific events occur in your LMS.        

**Action Webhooks (Incoming)**: Allow external applications to trigger actions within Masteriyo.        

## What are Webhooks?
Webhooks allow different applications to communicate automatically with each other in real-time. When an event occurs in one application, it can notify another through webhooks, triggering specific actions or transferring data without manual intervention.

## Trigger Webhooks (Outgoing Data)
Trigger webhooks send data from your Masteriyo LMS to external applications whenever specific events occur on your site.

### Setting Up Trigger Webhooks
1. Navigate to **Masteriyo > Webhoooks** in your WordPress admin dashboard.   
2. Click **Add New Webhook**.

        Note: The Event will vary for the admin and the instructors.

**Secret(Optional)** - This helps you identify if a malicious third-party system has altered the data before it reaches its destination.

After filling in all the required information, click on **Create** to save the webhook.
