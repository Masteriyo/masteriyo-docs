**Webhooks** are a powerful feature in Masteriyo that enables real-time communication between your WordPress LMS and external applications. This documentation covers both types of webhook functionality available in Masteriyo:

**Trigger Webhooks (Outgoing)**: Send data from Masteriyo to external applications when specific events occur in your LMS.        

**Action Webhooks (Incoming)**: Allow external applications to trigger actions within Masteriyo.        

## What are Webhooks?
Webhooks allow different applications to communicate automatically with each other in real-time. When an event occurs in one application, it can notify another through webhooks, triggering specific actions or transferring data without manual intervention.

## Trigger Webhooks (Outgoing Data)
Trigger webhooks send data from your Masteriyo LMS to external applications whenever specific events occur on your site.

### Setting Up Trigger Webhooks
1. Navigate to **Masteriyo > Webhoooks** in your WordPress admin dashboard.   
2. Click **Add New Webhook**.

3. Configure the webhook with the following settings:
- **Webhook Name** - Provide a name for the Webhook.
- **Description** - Describe the purpose of the Webhook.
- **Status(Active)** - Enable this to make the Webhook active.
- **Delivery URL** - Enter the URL where you want to send the data.
- **Events** - Lets you select the desired event for sending the data. There are various events available.        

 ![Setup Webhook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masteriyo/masteriyo-docs/main/assets/images/webhooks/setup-webhook.png)        

        Note: The Event will vary for the admin and the instructors.

**Secret(Optional)** - This helps you identify if a malicious third-party system has altered the data before it reaches its destination.

After filling in all the required information, click on **Create** to save the webhook.        

### Available Trigger Events
Masteriyo offers various events that can trigger webhooks:

### Trigger Webhook Payload Format        

Masteriyo sends data to your specified URL using HTTP POST in JSON format when a trigger event occurs.

## Action Webhooks (Incoming Data) [Pro]
