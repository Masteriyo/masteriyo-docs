## WooCommerce Subscription Support

### Configuration

### How to remove the product or unlink it completely from Masteriyo?

If you decide to unlink the product or separate it from Masteriyo, you will need to delete the product completely.

The WooCommerce feature will automatically create a product on your Dashboard under the "Products" section when you create a product through your course.

To separate the product from your course, navigate to your Dashboard, then go to "Products" and select "All products." Find the product created for the Masteriyo course and delete it. This will move the product to the trash. To completely remove the product, locate it in the trash and delete it permanently.

  {" "}
  If the students purchase the course(create as a prodcut) via the WooCommerce, the
  emails, payments, registration via checkout, and order details are then handled
  by the WooCommerce. However, the customers will automatically be enrolled to the
  Masteriyo Course once they purchase the product. Order Received Page(redirected
  after the order is confirmed), also know as Thank You page, is created by the WooCommerce
  in this case. You can customize this page to show the enrolled course details to
  the customers/students. [To learn how to customize this page, click here.](https://woocommerce.com/posts/customize-woocommerce-thank-you-confirmation-page/)
