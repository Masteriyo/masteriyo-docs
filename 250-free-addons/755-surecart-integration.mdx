- While creating/editing a product, you will find a section within the product editor page to set up an integration.

![product-integration-surecart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7ef179f-1e9d-4479-9699-1e81bee857f4)

- Here, click on the **Add New Integration** button. Search for the **MasteriyoLMS Course** and select it.

![add-masteriyo-integration-on-surecart-product](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddda1fe9-78f2-4cda-9c84-aceb5c2bf448)

- Now, choose a course from the **Course Access** dropdown.

![select-course-in-surecart-product](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/458867e1-42ac-4c33-ade2-afd99e553c25)

- Click on \*_Add Integration_ button.

Now, the price you have set for this product will be set as the price for the integrated course. You can check this from **Masteriyo > Courses**.

To purchase the product, you can access the store or the Masteriyo Courses page.

<callout> **Note** This integration is designed to let SureCart handle all processes including orders, sign-ups during checkout, emails about orders and sign-ups, and the page you see after buying. The default page you see after buying doesn't show how to access your course. If you want to add a link to access purcahsed course for students, please look at this guide: https://surecart.com/docs/custom-thank-you-page/. You can then put the link to your Masteriyo Account page's course section on the SureCart page you see after buying.
Also, if someone isn't signing up through your SureCart payment page, please look at this guide: https://surecart.com/docs/password-field-checkout/.
