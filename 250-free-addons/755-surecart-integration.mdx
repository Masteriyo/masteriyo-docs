excerpt: How to integrate the SureCart plugin with Materiyo?
---


  This integration is designed to let SureCart handle all processes, including
  orders, sign-ups during checkout, emails about orders and sign-ups, and the
  page you see after buying. After buying, The default page needs to show
  how to access your course. If you want to add a link to access purchased
  courses for students, please look at this guide:
  [https://surecart.com/docs/custom-thank-you-page](https://surecart.com/docs/custom-thank-you-page). You can then put the link to
  your Masteriyo Account page's course section on the SureCart page you see
  after buying.


  Also, if someone isn't signing up through your SureCart payment page, please
  look at this guide: [https://surecart.com/docs/password-field-checkout](https://surecart.com/docs/password-field-checkout)
