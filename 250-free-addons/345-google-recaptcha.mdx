### reCAPTCHA Version Support
Masteriyo's Google reCAPTCHA addon supports **reCAPTCHA v2** ("I'm not a robot" Checkbox) and **reCAPTCHA v3** (invisible background verification). Choose the version that best fits your user experience requirements: 

#### reCAPTCHA v2 
•	**Checkbox**: Users click "I'm not a robot". 

•	**Invisible**: Runs in the background, shows challenge when needed. 

•	**Best for**: Sites where user interaction confirmation is preferred. 


#### reCAPTCHA v3
•	**Score-based**: Analyzes user behavior and assigns risk scores. 

•	**Invisible**: Completely seamless user experience. 

•	**Best for**: High-traffic sites prioritizing user experience. 


So, visit [Google reCAPTCHA console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/) and click on the Get Started button to generate the required keys. 

### Register Your Site
Enter all the necessary information to register your site: 
-	**Label**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., Masteriyo). 
-	Choose **reCAPTCHA type**:   
  o	Score based (v3)  
  o	Challenge (v2) 
-	**Domains**: Add your website domains. 
-	**Google Cloud Platform**: Under the **Project Name**, give a descriptive name to your project (e.g., Masteriyo Testing).

**Security Note**: Keep your secret key confidential and never expose it in frontend code.  
</Callout> 

## Step 4: Configure reCAPTCHA in Masteriyo 
You can access settings through your dashboard, as you did in Step 2. So, navigate to **Masteriyo > Settings > Authentication > reCAPTCHA**.  

Next, select the reCAPTCHA Version for which you have generated the site key. Now, paste the keys under their respective fields. 

**Forms**: Select which forms you  would like reCAPTCHA to appear in.

### reCAPTCHA v3 Settings (if using v3) 

**Captcha Score**: You can adjust the captcha score from 0.1 to 0.9 for reCAPTCHA v3. 

**Load CAPTCHA v3 scripts on**: Select where the CAPTCHA should appear on all pages or only on form pages.

  - google.com: Standard Google reCAPTCHA service
  - Alternative option: "recaptcha.net" for regions where google.com might be blocked   

**Theme**: Choose between light or dark theme for reCAPTCHA. 
Here's how the dark theme appears:

**Size**: Choose either normal or compact size for the reCAPTCHA.  
**Error Message**: Customize error message for users who don’t complete the captcha.
