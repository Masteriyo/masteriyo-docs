### Step 2: Configure Mollie's Settings
Go to **Masteriyo > Settings> Payments > Mollie**  to customize the payment gateway:

#### Enable/Disable Mollie
Toggle to enable or disable Mollie as a payment method. When enabled, Mollie appears as an option during checkout. Now, you’ll be asked to fill in other information:

![configure-mollie-setitngs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/116368c3-545b-412a-8838-5b6438b5d86a)

**Title:** It’s the name displayed to customers during checkout. You can modify the default title – Mollie, and add any customized title (e.g., “Secure Mollie Payment)  
**Description:** This is a brief explanation for customers about the payment method. You can modify or keep the default description as it is.  
**Sandbox:** Toggle to enable **(for testing)** or disable **(for live transactions)**. Transactions processed during Sandbox mode use dummy data and do not charge real money. 

### API Keys
**Test API Key (Required for Sandbox):**  
        - Obtain this key from your Mollie dashboard under Developers > API Keys.  
        - Paste it here when Sandbox is enabled.  
**Live API Key (Required for Production):**  
        - Obtain this key from your Mollie dashboard under Developers > API Keys.  
        - Paste it here after disabling Sandbox.  

Disable Sandbox, if you’re ready with the transaction for real. Click in **Save Setting** to save all configured Mollie settings. 


### Step 3: Test and Go Live

<Callout>
  {" "} 
  To test Mollie payments with automatic status updates, your website must be hosted on a publicly accessible domain (e.g., .com, .me, .net). Mollie checkout flows will not work in local/test environments (e.g., localhost), as Mollie cannot communicate with non-public domains. However, even with publicly accessible domains, you will not have access to Mollie webhooks
</Callout>    


**Sandbox Testing:**  
    •	Process a test transaction to ensure payments work in dummy mode.  
    •	Verify Mollie’s test card numbers or use the Mollie test dashboard.  

**Live Transactions:**  
    •	Disable **Sandbox Mode** and enter your **Live API Key**.  
    •	Ensure your Mollie account is activated for live payments.  

## Checkout Experience

During the checkout, the interface will look similar to the image below:

As soon as customer click on Proceed to Mollie, it redirects to Mollie’s Secure Payment Page from where they can enter card details and confirm the transaction. 

![mollie-test-checkout](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49c709b7-cec4-4dfa-b160-3025fe39c19c)

Mollie then processes the payment and verifies it. You can see the payment status on your dashboard Masteriyo > Orders.
