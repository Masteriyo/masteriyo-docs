## What is the Groups Feature?

The **Groups** feature allows you to sell your courses to teams and organizations. Instead of selling to individual students, you can sell to groups with features like:

- **Multiple pricing tiers** for different team sizes
- **Group leader management** where buyers can add/remove team members
- **Flexible seat configurations** with volume discounts
- **Administrative controls** for enrollment and approvals

## What is Multiple Group Pricing? (v3.1.0+) [Pro]

Starting with version 3.1.0, Groups includes **multiple group pricing** capability, allowing you to create **multiple pricing tiers** for the same course. Instead of having just one group price, you can offer different options like "Small Team," "Medium Business," and "Enterprise" - each with their own pricing structure and seat configurations.

Think of it like SaaS pricing plans, but for your courses. You can offer volume discounts, flexible seat ranges, and tiered pricing to attract different customer segments.

## Key Benefits

- **Available for All Plans**: Groups feature available in Free, Basic, Pro, and Elite plans
- **Flexible Pricing Tiers**: Create unlimited pricing options (Pro/Elite) or 1 tier (Free/Basic)
- **Volume Discounts**: Reward larger purchases with better per-seat prices (Pro/Elite)
- **Fixed or Variable Seats**: Offer specific seat counts (all plans) or flexible ranges (Pro/Elite)
- **Tiered Pricing Model**: Set different per-seat prices for different quantity ranges (Pro/Elite)
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Perfect for B2B course sales and corporate training
- **Automatic Migration**: Seamlessly upgrades from legacy single group pricing

## Requirements

- Masteriyo Free, Basic, Pro, or Elite plan
- Version 3.1.0 or higher
- Groups addon enabled

<Callout>
  Note: Free and Basic plans are limited to 1 pricing tier with fixed seats
  only. Pro and Elite plans unlock unlimited tiers, variable seats, and advanced
  pricing models.
</Callout>

## Differences from Legacy Group Pricing

### Legacy Single Group Pricing

The old system allowed only one group pricing option:

- Single fixed price (e.g., $500 for 10 people)
- One maximum group size
- Simple but limited

### New Multiple Group Pricing (v3.1.0+)

The new system provides enterprise-level flexibility:

- **Multiple pricing tiers** per course (Pro/Elite: unlimited, Free/Basic: 1 tier)
- **Two seat models**: Fixed seats (all plans) or Variable seats (Pro/Elite)
- **Two pricing models**: Per-seat or Tiered pricing (Pro/Elite)
- **Volume discounts** through tiered pricing (Pro/Elite)
- Available across all Masteriyo plans with progressive features

<Callout>
  Note: If you were using legacy group pricing, your existing settings will
  automatically migrate to a single pricing tier in the new format.

## Understanding Seat Models

| Feature          | Fixed Seats                              | Variable Seats                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it is**   | A specific, unchangeable number of seats | A range of seats customers can choose from (min-max) |
| **Pricing**      | One total price for all seats            | Two options (see Pricing Models below)               |
| **Example**      | "Small Team - 10 seats for $1,000"       | "Enterprise - Choose 11-50 seats"                    |
| **Use case**     | Standard team sizes, package deals       | Scalable teams, custom group sizes                   |
| **Availability** | All plans (Free, Basic, Pro, Elite)      | Pro or Elite plan only                               |
| **Best for**     | Predefined team packages                 | Flexible, varying team sizes                         |

## Understanding Pricing Models

Pricing models only apply to **Variable Seats** (Pro/Elite plans only).

| Feature         | Per-Seat Pricing                 | Tiered Pricing                                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Formula**     | Price per seat × Number of seats | Different per-seat prices for different quantity ranges                          |
| **Example**     | $50/seat × 20 seats = $1,000     | • 11-25 seats: $45/seat<br/>• 26-50 seats: $40/seat<br/>• 51-100 seats: $35/seat |
| **Calculation** | Single rate applies to all seats | Rate depends on total quantity selected (e.g., 30 seats × $40 = $1,200)          |
| **Use case**    | Simple, predictable pricing      | Encourage larger purchases with volume discounts                                 |
| **Display**     | Shows "$50/seat"                 | Shows price range "$45-$35/seat"                                                 |
| **Best for**    | Straightforward pricing needs    | Incentivizing bulk purchases                                                     |

## Setting Up Tiered Pricing [Pro]

Tiered pricing can be tricky, so here's a detailed walkthrough:

### Step 1: Choose Variable Seats

2. Select **Seat Model: Variable Seats**
3. Enter min and max (e.g., Min: 10, Max: 100)

### Step 2: Select Tiered Pricing Model

1. Under **Pricing Model**, choose **Tiered Pricing**
2. You'll see options to add price tiers

### Step 3: Add Price Tiers

For each price break, add a tier:

| Tier | From | To  | Per Seat Price | Total Cost (Min-Max) |
| ---- | ---- | --- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | 10   | 25  | $80            | $800 - $2,000        |
| 2    | 26   | 50  | $70            | $1,820 - $3,500      |
| 3    | 51   | 100 | $60            | $3,060 - $6,000      |

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Make sure:

- Ranges don't overlap
- Ranges cover your entire min-max range (10-100)
- Prices decrease as quantity increases (volume discount)
- There are no gaps between ranges

  **Important**: The "From" of each tier should be 1 more than the "To" of the
  previous tier.

## Plan Comparison

### Free and Basic Plans

- Create **1 pricing tier only**
- **Fixed seats model only** (e.g., "10 seats for $500")
- Single total price per tier (no per-seat or tiered pricing)
- Perfect for getting started with group sales
- Sell to teams and organizations

### Pro and Elite Plans

- Create **unlimited pricing tiers**
- Use **Fixed Seats** (like Free/Basic) or **Variable Seats** model
- Use **Per-Seat Pricing** or **Tiered Pricing** with volume discounts
- Mix and match seat models and pricing models
- Full flexibility for enterprise sales
- Advanced B2B pricing strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Customers Can't See Multiple Tiers

- Verify you're on Pro or Elite plan (Free and Basic plans show only 1 tier)
- Check that "Sell to Groups" is enabled in course settings
- Ensure you've created and saved multiple pricing tiers
- Clear browser and WordPress caches

### Price Not Calculating Correctly

- For tiered pricing: Verify ranges are continuous without gaps
- Check that min/max seats match your tier ranges
- Ensure there's no overlap between price tier ranges
- Test calculation manually: seats × per-seat price for that range

### Customers Can't Complete Purchase

- Verify the Groups addon is active
- Check that selected tier is published/active
- Ensure seat selection is within allowed range
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console

### Legacy Group Pricing Not Showing

- Your old settings automatically migrated to a single tier
- Edit the course and you'll see the migrated tier
- You can now add more tiers or modify the existing one

### Can't Add More Tiers

- Check your plan: Free and Basic plans allow only 1 tier
- Upgrade to Pro or Elite for unlimited tiers
- Verify you're clicking "Add Pricing Tier" button

## Migration from Legacy

If you were using the legacy single group pricing:

### What Happens Automatically

Your existing group pricing data automatically converts to the new format:

- Old group price → First tier's regular price
- Old max group size → First tier's fixed seats
- Group name defaults to "Group"

### What You Should Do

1. Edit your course to review the migrated tier
2. Optionally rename the tier (e.g., from "Group" to "Standard Team")
3. Add more tiers to offer multiple options (Pro/Elite plans)
4. Consider switching to variable seats or tiered pricing for more flexibility

### Data Safety

- Your original data remains in the database
- Migration is non-destructive
- You can always view/edit the migrated tier
- Customer purchases remain unaffected

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I mix fixed and variable seats in one course?

Yes! You can create multiple tiers with different seat models. For example:

- Tier 1: Fixed 5 seats
- Tier 2: Variable 10-50 seats
- Tier 3: Variable 51-100 seats with tiered pricing

### How many pricing tiers can I create?

- **Free and Basic plans**: 1 tier only
- **Pro and Elite plans**: Unlimited tiers

### Can customers buy multiple tiers?

No. Customers select one tier per purchase. If they want more seats, they can make a separate purchase or choose a larger tier.

### Do group members need individual accounts?

Yes. When the group creator adds members by email, those members receive invitations to create accounts or log in to access the course.

### Can I change pricing after orders are placed?

Yes, you can update pricing tiers anytime. However, existing orders/groups maintain their original pricing. Only new purchases use the updated pricing.

### Does this work with payment gateways?

Yes! Multiple group pricing works with all Masteriyo-supported payment gateways including PayPal, Stripe, and offline payments.

### How do I offer free trials or coupons for groups?

Use the Coupons addon to create discount codes that work with group purchases. Apply the coupon at checkout.

### Can group leaders add members immediately after purchase?

No. Group leaders must wait for admin approval. After purchasing, the group has "Draft" status and members cannot be added until an admin changes the order status to "Completed."

### What happens if a group leader removes a member?

Depending on your settings ("Deactivate Enrollment on Member Change"), the removed member may lose access to group courses. They will also receive a notification email if configured.

### Can I remove myself from my own group?

No. The group leader (purchaser) cannot remove themselves from the group. Only admins can change group ownership.

### Where do group leaders manage their groups?

Group leaders access their groups through **Account → Groups** in the sidebar menu. This menu item only appears for users who have purchased at least one group course.

### Can group leaders see other people's groups?

No. Group leaders can only view and manage groups they've created/purchased. Only admins can see all groups.

### What if I want to add more members than my purchased seats?

You cannot exceed the seat limit of your purchased tier. You would need to purchase another group or contact the admin about upgrading your existing group.

### Do group members get enrolled automatically?

Yes. When a group leader adds a member's email and saves, that member receives an invitation email. Once they create an account (or log in), they're automatically enrolled in all courses associated with that group.

### Can group leaders delete their groups?

Yes. Group leaders can delete groups they own from the Groups page. This action is permanent and will deactivate all member enrollments (if settings configured).
