FluentCRM is a self-hosted email marketing plugin for WordPress. It lets you manage leads, customers, email campaigns, automated email sequences, learner and affiliate management, track user activities, and much more from your WordPress dashboard!

The Masteriyo FluentCRM integration helps you connect with  FluentCRM and makes it easy to register your Masteriyo users on the FluentCRM platform.

## Requires

1. [FluentCRM Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluent-crm/)
2. [FluentCRM Integration Add-on](https://docs.masteriyo.com/getting-started/activate-masteriyo-addons)

## Configuration

Once you have installed FluentCRM Plugin and activated the FluentCRM Integration add-on, follow the steps below:
 
- Go to **Fluent CRM > Automation > New Automation > Create from Scratch**
- Move to Masteriyo LMS to select the trigger for automation.

The available triggers for the automation are: 
- Course Started - This funnel runs when a student starts a new course.
- Course Completed - This funnel runs when a student completes a course.
- Paid Course - This funnel runs when a student starts a new paid course.

Let's see an example of automation for Course Started. To do so, click on Course Started and then continue.

You can now set the Automation Name, Description, Subscription status, add conditions, and target courses for the trigger. Once you are done, Click on Save Settings.

Now, you need to add an action that will be executed for the trigger.

Here are the lists of actions available with Fluent CRM. Masteriyo also adds its actions as **Enroll To Course** and **Remove From a Course**

Let's send an Email and remove the user from a course once the trigger is active. From the action blocks, click on Send Custom Email and compose your message. We have also provided template placeholders so you can create dynamic emails.

Now, you can add another action to remove the user from a course.

Here is the complete automation flow.

Similarly, you can add other automations with different triggers.
